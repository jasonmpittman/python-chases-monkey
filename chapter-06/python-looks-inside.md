# Chapter 6
## Python Looks Inside

## Introduction
[done]()
It is time for Phil the python to gain a measure of introspection. Perhaps counting its scales has led the python to question why it has scales in the first place. Alternatively, maybe Phil has seen the monkey and is pondering from where the instinct to chase it originates. Of course, the same can be said for the monkey. 

In all honesty, this is a fancy way of indicating that we have enough going on in our programs to consider *auxillary* topics. Some of you might be wondering why we're covering these topics in the middle of the book as opposed to the end. If I'm being honest, it isn't because exception handling, efficiency, debugging, or logging are more important than a topic such as **data structures**. Instead, these topics are important enough that we ought to begin incorporating them into our programming lexicon sooner rather than later. As well, our *python chases monkey* program is becomming large enough to warrant introducing these ideas now.

With that, let's step back and take in the entire scene. The tree canopy is full and green. The monkey has frozen to avoid being seen by the python. The python is uncoiled, gently tasting the air to locate the source of the movement it has heard. Both animals begin to consider their options...

## Learning Outcomes
[done]()
1. Distinguish between types of exceptions and the means to handle each within a program
2. Utilize the standard python debugger to resolve errors and test code
3. Log internal program information to external endpoints

### Exception Handling
[](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/)
A brief definition is in order before we start exploring **exceptions** in detail. **Exceptions** are error conditions that arise during runtime in otherwise *correct* code. We can const

Broadly speaking, **exceptions** can be separated into two forms: built-in and user-defined. Both operate identically albeit one is implicit (built-in) and the other must be explicitly called (user-defined). Further, the important takeaway now is that we must comes to grips with how to handle both forms of exceptions.

#### Built-in
[done]()
Let's do a quick Python experiment. Imagine the monkey wants to calculate the number of bananas available across all of the trees within its immediate area. Being a monkey, it doesn't use the calculator correctly. To simulate what a monkey might do, run `print(0 / 0)` in your interpreter. 

We should expect to get an error since computers don't handle division by zero. Specifically in this case, we ought to see `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero` returned by the interpreter. Perfect.

This little experiment demonstrates one of the many built-in forms of exceptions. However, we knew ahead of time that we would get an exception. What about handling exceptions that may arise unexpectedly? Python is rather smart in this regard and includes two keywords for us to use: `try` and `except`. Rather than belabor the point, let's take our earlier experiment and translate it into a new example with these keywords.

#### Example 1
```
(1) def divide():
(2)     try:
(3)         print(0 / 0)
(4)     except Exception as e:
(5)         print(e)
```

There are two points of interest in **Example 1**. First, `try` and `except` form a pairwise pattern for **exception handling**. That is, `try` sets up an attempt to execute a statement while `except` gives us an opportunity to do something if the result of the attempted statement is an exception. Then, secondly, we can execute any logic within the scope of the `except` block. That's a pretty cool trick to know about so that we don't become trapped (he he he) into thinking we can only output the exception. 

Moreover, we can stack our `except` blocks as shown in **Example 2**. 

#### Example 2
```
(1) def divide(x, y):
(2)     try:
(3)         print(x / y)
(4)     except ZeroDivision as e_zero:
(5)         print(e_zero)
(6)     except Exception as e:
(7)         print(e)
```

This example shows how we can stack the handling of exceptions so that we can respond differently to different conditions. This is a more advanced technique but can be quite useful when we have code capable of producing varying levels of exceptions. One tip: always place the more specific exception catch before less specific blocks in these cases.

Lastly, if we are interested in producing robust code, and we should be, then wrapping our code in `try-except` blocks is one of the strongest habits to develop. This applies to built-in functionality as well as the functionality we implement in our own types. 

#### User-defined
It stands to reason that since we are designing our own **types** (e.g. `Snake`, `Animal`, `Monkey` and so forth), we can also define our own **exceptions**.

The implicit operation in the built-in form of an **exception** includes a `raise` call. 

### Efficiency
The notion of efficiency is not explored often in an introductory programming course. To be fair, I hadn't thought about effiency until a university colleague mentioned it during a lunch discussion.

Efficiency is measurable. I would go so far as to say that efficiency is *easily* measurable. Wait, I think we should go one step further and agree that all code should include an efficiency measuring harness as part of its debugging structures.

### Debugging (https://codeburst.io/how-i-use-python-debugger-to-fix-code-279f11f75866)
Speaking of debugging, I would rank general debugging skills as more desirable than advanced programming knowledge. There is a straightforward rationale and that is if you can debug, you'll be able to fix bugs in someone else's code as well as your own. If you cannot debug effectively, you will struggle to troubleshoot just your own code.

#### Print
Use the `print()` function has to be the most common form of debugging. 

Leveraging `print()` has the advantages of not requiring specialized knowledge and being easy to implement.

In contrast, `print()` has the disadvantages of being reactive and working at a low level of resolution. 

The best metaphor I can summon is that using `print()` as a debugger is like hearing someone talk on the phone. You passively hear one side of the conversation and then only in an after-the-fact manner.

#### PDB


The real power and beauty of using a debugger comes from being able to proactively interact with our code. 

Continuing the phone metaphor; using PDB let's us join the call from the beginning. We can actively participate and steer the conversation.

### Logging
The motivation for logging is, in my view, the same for having a window; you want to be able to see. However, in the case of programming, the *seeing* occurs in the reverse direction. We want, we need to be able to see into the program. More specifically, we want to see the state of the program; the values, program flow, and results of computational processing.

I don't want to get too far into a technical implementation because we deal with file input and output in a later chapter. For now, let's stick with the concept of logging and dig into *how* to log and leave *where* for a later discussion.

We have two options when it comes to implementing logging. First, we can design our own logging mechanism. This can be as simple as writing to a file instead of using `print()`. Second, we can use the `logging` module included in the base Python language architecture.

My advice: use the native `logging` module. Using an existing wheel is almost always better than reinventing it. Logging is definitely a wheel that is not worth redoing on our own unless we have a very specific reason to do so.

Something to know about the default `logging` module is that we can specify different levels of logging. Here, we can connect the concept of logging to the practice of debugging and create a bridge of sorts between the reactive `print()` method and the active `pdb` technique. 


## Exercises
1. Modify **Example 1** so that the function executes a valid division operation in the `except` block.

## Questions
1. What is the difference, if any, between an **exception** and a **syntax error**?

2. Why do we position more specific `except` blocks before general blocks?
