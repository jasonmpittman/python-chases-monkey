# Python Chases Monkey
### An Introduction to Python Programming
#### By Jason M. Pittman
<hr>

Welcome to `Python Chases Monkey`, an open source textbook I created for my CSC1705 Python Programming course at [High Point University](www.highpoint.edu).

I provide several methods to access the textbook content. You can mix and match whatever works best for you. You can view each chapter in your browser by clicking on the associated **Table of Contents** link below. You'll be viewing the source Markdown. Also, you can browse to the associated repository directory in your browser and load the Markdown directly. There is also a PDF in each directory if you prefer that file format. You can clone this repository. Then, you can either view the Markdown, the PDF, or you can compile your own PDF from the Markdown. An example using pandoc (which is what I use) looks like:

`pandoc markdown.md -o output.pdf`

I encourage you to reach out to me if you have suggestions, typo fixes, or comments. You can either submit a bug, pull request, or send me an email. Of course, the material is covered under a Creative Commons SA-BY 4.0 license so you can reuse, remix, and reshare.

If you find this material useful, here is a link you can use to buy me a coffee or pay what you think a book like this is worth.
